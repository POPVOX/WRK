Congress has made important strides in understanding and making use of artificial intelligence, according to POPVOX’s Marci Harris, who says these skills among members and staff will improve the overall legislative process -- and the content of bills -- as lawmakers consider AI policy questions.

The AI tools available to Congress even now are “game-changing,” Harris told Inside AI Policy, and members and staff “need to understand this availability and feel comfortable experimenting with it.”

“It won’t slow down, the technology will keep changing, and the question is whether Congress is chasing the train with a race car or a bicycle,” Harris said.",,"AI, Rules",yes - based on Rules pitch

Marci Harris of the POPVOX Foundation, a good-government group, said reducing the committee assignments of members would be another benefit.

“In our increasingly complex world, there is, you know, the argument that more specialization, or the ability for each individual member to kind of specialize on fewer topics, would give them a little bit more expertise and opportunity to go deeper,” she said.

But adding representatives could make it more difficult for party leaders to achieve consensus among their members, complicating the legislative process.

“Invariably Congress and whipping votes is always likened to herding cats,” Harris explained. “If you’re adding 150 or 190 cats, that’s many more to herd.”

Expanding the House could also lead to a more basic problem — a lack of office space.

“The reports of staffers working in closets is not just hyperbole,” Harris said. A report from the POPVOX Foundation and Project Democracy proposed that an expansion of House seats could be coupled with the construction of a new office building, with open spaces to encourage bipartisan collaboration.

“Having a place where people can collaborate, or run into each other, or pull up a few tables and sit down together … those are the kinds of things that can facilitate good relationships,” Harris said.","Marci, POPVOX Foundation",modernization,"yes, tho she learned via a newsletter (wasn't sure which)"
2/11/2025,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/11/5-calls-app-call-representative/,Shira Ovide,"In-depth interview with Anne on effective civic engagement since Congress is getting flooded by constituent calls, etc. due to an app called 5 Calls. Also links to Voice/Mail!

“They are absolutely being overwhelmed by the volume of calls,” said Anne Meeker, deputy director of Popvox Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on social and technology changes in citizen engagement.
 Experienced congressional staffers have been enlisted to take calls, which is usually a task for junior staff or interns, Meeker said.

...Meeker said that from her conversations with congressional staff, many calls are from people furious about Trump administration actions or asking for personal help with government funding freezes. Supporters of the administration also are calling lawmakers to urge them to approve Trump’s Cabinet nominees.

Meeker said elected officials are coming to terms with ways that technology can boost, or potentially undermine, their relationships with voters...

It’s not necessarily true that phone calls are more effective than emails. Meeker said congressional staffers log constituent calls, voicemails and emails into the same software system. Citizens’ opinions from each method are relayed to members of Congress. “There really is no distinction,” she said.

Some organizations have promising technology-aided ideas to improve constituent town halls, which tend to be poorly attended and dominated by a few loud voices. On the flip side, Meeker said technology can erode lawmakers’ trust in public input. One group used AI-generated voices in calls to legislators that sounded like children who died of gun violence. 

Consider your call as a start, not the end. Meeker said apps like 5 Calls are a great first step for consistent and deepening contact with elected officials about what matters to you. “Be willing to put that time into that relationship,” she said.

If you go in person, call ahead. For security reasons, many legislators’ local offices don’t allow visitors unless they have an appointment.

Congress members’ Washington offices are open to the public, with security restrictions, but Meeker said you might want to call ahead anyway — if only to arrange a guided tour of the U.S. Capitol by congressional staff. “It’s an awesome experience,” Meeker said.

Do some homework. Meeker suggested tailoring your message to the committees on which your members of Congress serve or bills they have sponsored. If your senator is on a finance committee, for example, you might talk to them about local economic effects of White House policies.

Make it about more than you. Meeker was a congressional staff member for about three years. When someone called for help with a mix-up in their veterans benefits, it stood out when the caller wanted to make sure no one else was hurt by the problem. “I was always so moved by that sentiment,” she said.","Anne Meeker, POPVOX Foundation",constituent engagement,no

“DOGE could avoid a lot of the questions and speculation by being more transparent about where teams are working, which software or AI models they are using, what data and security protocols they are practicing, how team members are vetted, and confirming that data protocols are being followed,” Harris said. “In the absence of this transparency, it is appropriate for Congress to ask for clarification and should be a bipartisan priority.”","Marci, POPVOX Foundation","DOGE, AI",no

...According to Meeker [LINK HERE TO https://voicemailgov.substack.com/p/constituent-services-in-crisis], calls coming into congressional offices can be placed into two categories: people voicing their opinions, and constituents requesting help after being affected by a move from the Trump administration.

""There are pros and cons to having an office in a federal building, according to Anne Meeker, who is deputy director at the nonprofit POPVOX Foundation and a former congressional caseworker.

Federal buildings can be imposing and unwelcoming, whereas offices located on main streets may get more foot traffic and appear more accessible to constituents, Meeker said. But federal buildings can also be more convenient.

In some cases, they serve as a one-stop shop for constituents, with a multitude of services located under the same roof. And they tend to come equipped with some kind of existing security apparatus.

'It’s definitely a security thing, that as offices are handling issues with protesters and security threats, it is just handy to be in a building that already comes with some built-in screening mechanism, so that office doesn’t have to set up on their own,' Meeker said.""

3/17/2025,Now What (Substack),https://nowwhatnehls.substack.com/p/remembering-rep-grijalvas-embrace,Chris Nehls,"Chris honors the recently deceased Rep. Grijalva by sharing deliberative bill writing process he did with POPVOX Foundation (and others):

""As chair of the Natural Resources Committee, Rep. Grijalva ran what is to my knowledge the most complete deliberative bill writing process for a major piece of legislation in the history of Congress. It was a masterful example of bringing advocates, local people, and congressional members and staff together to develop something that could satisfy everyone and how just the right technology could facilitate key parts of the process.

The bill I’m referencing was the 2020 Environmental Justice for All Act. Rep. Grijalva had drafted a similar bill in 2014, but admitted he hadn’t consulted with environmental groups before doing so. The bill, accordingly, found limited enthusiasm within the community. In reworking the measure, Grijalva resolved to use an open and collaborative process with stakeholders in 2019.

Fortunately by then, I had been able to provide support through Democracy Fund to practitioners and civic technologists who could make this process a reality. I was so excited when Beeck Center’s Lorelei Kelly introduced me to Chris Espinosa on the committee’s staff, who explained how he wanted to use engement and comment platforms developed by the POPVOX Foundation and OpenGov Foundation for the entire process, from gathering stakeholder input to editing the final bill text.

That summer, Chair Grijalva and subcommittee chair McEachin hosted an in-person and virtual convening that kicked off a request for input process to establish the initial set of principles that should be reflected in the bill. POPVOX developed a site on its LegiDash portal to allow other members of Congress to provide their input on the bill’s principles as well. The POPVOX team then dusted off OpenGov Foundation’s Madison bill drafting and comment platform to allow inline comments on bill text and input from different stakeholders and community members in the markup phase. These comments could be entered into the Congressional Record through the platform.""",POPVOX Foundation,"legislative innovation, constituent engagement",no

...Danielle Stewart, adviser for congressional initiatives at POPVOX and a former Hill chief of staff, called on lawmakers to examine the feasibility of a House Casework Support Office that could serve as a central hub. Congressional staff are dealing with a spike in complex requests from constituents since President Donald Trump took office and began slashing executive agencies.

She also made the case for the Congress to invest in remote voting, a timely issue given that the House put the kibosh on a push to allow proxy voting for new parents a day earlier. 

“This effort is not about excusing absences. It’s about ensuring continuity of operations during emergencies or when in-person gatherings become impossible,” Stewart said. “Other major legislatures, including Canada and the U.K., have implemented secure remote voting options for their members.

Outside groups are also filling the education gap. The POPVOX Foundation, a civic tech
nonprofit group, has been training congressional staff on how to use large language
models effectively and responsibly.
“We’ve talked to staff who are using it as they would work with an intern — to help

streamline research by summarizing reports, translating legislative text into easy-to-
understand talking points, or helping to pull the main points out of witnesses’ submitted

written testimony prior to a hearing,” said Aubrey Wilson, the group’s director of
government innovation and a former House legislative aide.

...For POPVOX’s government innovation director, Wilson, offices are increasingly using
generative AI to repackage material and improve access to information. The technology
isn’t replacing humans, she noted, but it is becoming a key support tool for staff trying to
keep up with growing demands.
“As the Chambers continue to update their guidance and approve additional tools, we look
forward to helping staff realize their full potential through using this emerging technology,”
Wilson said.

“This is the time for Congress to embrace the internal use of AI,” Wilson said. “We’re seeing the proliferation of the use of the technology by the executive branch, and without the legislative branch doing the same to keep pace, it’s the equivalent of using a calculator to double-check the work of a supercomputer.”

Field Guide friend and POPVOX founder Marci Harris spoke to these issues from her mainstage OGP session. She mentioned parliaments POPVOX is working with in the Caribbean to leap from paper-based systems to the most advanced state of the art tech possible.


Marci also noted that the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence is coming up next year. And while that will (hopefully) trigger some soul-searching about how we're doing with our founding principles, she argues that those revolution and immediate post-revolution years were no less a time of great change than today:


“What I’m interested in celebrating is the 11 years that came after, where we had discussions and arguments and trials and beta versions and 1.0s trying to figure out how a free society governs itself in a new world. And I think we are the cusp of a new world…I think it is appropriate that we're are all feeling that the institutions of previous centuries need to be re-thought.”

The current lapse in government funding has taken what’s already a tough job and raised the stakes, said Anne Meeker, a former congressional caseworker.

Danielle Stewart, adviser for congressional initiatives at POPVOX Foundation, said for House offices, interns being furloughed has a ripple effect in a shutdown. 

“It is all hands on deck without two to three to four or five extra people in the office. They provide invaluable support to front office staff,” she said. “And the days where you don’t have that support, even on a regular week, yes, everyone has to answer the phones.” 

It can trickle down to congressional casework as well. 

“We’ve got a lot of constituents asking questions, and the staff are the ones on the front lines answering those questions for their constituents, for their districts,” she said. ","Danielle Stewart, POPVOX Foundation",no,

Lawyer and former congressional aide Marci Harris shares that view. Currently the executive director of Popvox, a nonprofit that seeks to modernize Congress, she has championed the use of the digital-­signature platform Quill, the better to end the longstanding practice of interns spending hours running around Capitol Hill collecting signatures on the “Dear Colleague” letters that members send one another. Technology and delegation, she says, make Washington go round—but pardons should be held to a higher signature standard. “I have a whole lot of sympathy for the view that if you are going to exercise the extreme power of the office of the President of the United States to levy the one power in the Constitution not subject to checks by any other branch, then I don’t care how tired your hand gets,” Harris says. (She adds that alternative arrangements can be made for physically limited commanders in chief.)

...Members of Congress, Harris says, set up their offices to match their management styles, which range from “absolutely nothing leaves this office unless I have my eyeballs on it” to “I defer everything to my chief of staff, who’s known me since law school.” Other leaders are similar. In theory, an ambitious underling could go rogue, using an autopen to sign off on something their boss would never approve otherwise—but in practice, that’s inviting big trouble. “If that’s not the actual wishes or preferences of the member,” says Miler, “you’re going to get fired.”","Marci Harris, POPVOX",no,

The Academic Edition: What the Latest Research Tells Us About AI in Parliaments

Beatriz Rey on November 12, 2025 in Modern Parliament by POPVOX Foundation

Legislatures are piloting AI for drafting, debates, and constituent outreach, but public trust is the constraint. UK and Japan surveys show voters accept AI assistance yet reject AI decision-making. Studies find transparent AI use improves satisfaction, while hidden use undermines it. Since 2022, AI references in parliamentary debates have spiked globally, shaped by national priorities such as U.S. security and EU ethics. Italy’s Chamber of Deputies, an early adopter of generative AI in legislative workflow, illustrates both efficiency gains and risks to neutrality and democratic legitimacy.","Beatriz Rey, POPVOX Foundation",no,

POPVOX highlights tech advances under outgoing House CAO, opportunities for progress with AI

The POPVOX Foundation says Catherine Szpindor, the outgoing Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, helped lead a historic technology modernization in the chamber that sets the stage for even more dramatic improvements led by artificial intelligence.

“Szpindor's legacy is worthy of celebration. Her tenure delivered measurable improvements across technology, staff development, and constituent services, implementing over 100 of the Select Committee on Modernization of Congress's 202 bipartisan recommendations while navigating the institution through pandemic-era challenges and beginning to ask questions about how AI will be deployed in the Legislative branch,” the group says in a Dec. 1 blog post, “The Path Forward: Continuing the CAO's Legacy of Leadership.”

“2026 will again bring transformational emerging technology and tension between America’s branches of government. The choice of who will lead the CAO in the years ahead will be a consequential element of whether the House meets the moment,” POPVOX says.

The group notes “Anne Binstead has been named as the interim CAO effective January 2026.”

In a release, POPVOX notes that Szpindor was the first woman to hold the CAO position, and that among her accomplishments she:

    led the House to be one of the first legislative bodies in the world to issue AI guidance;
    oversaw creation of the House Digital Service to bring agile development to Capitol Hill; and
    led the implementation of many Modernization Committee reforms to strengthen the Congressional workforce.
