# **How We Work**

*Helping democratic institutions keep pace with a rapidly changing world.*

| 01 | We build things. Not white papers about what someone else should build—actual tools, platforms, and resources that legislatures use today. We prototype fast, test with real users, and hand off what works to the institutions that need it. ▸ *ParlLink: an open-source, AI-enabled platform now digitizing legislative records across the Caribbean* ▸ *StaffLink: an AI chatbot for newly hired Hill staff, submitted for Congressional use in 2025* ▸ *CivX Metrics Toolkit: practical tools for measuring civic engagement beyond customer-service surveys* ▸ *Casework Navigator: a resource hub built for and with Congressional caseworkers* |
| ----: | :---- |

| 02 | We start from the people who do the work. Our projects begin with the staffers and institutional leaders who run legislatures day-to-day. They know what’s broken. We help them fix it—and we make sure the people with authority to make change hear what they have to say. ▸ *The Casework Navigator was shaped by frontline caseworkers and launched through practitioner webinars* ▸ *The Future of Constituent Engagement project connects legislative offices with researchers and technologists* ▸ *LegisTech documents tools Congress actually uses—often the only public-facing information about taxpayer-funded technology* |
| ----: | :---- |

| 03 | We move like water. Legislatures are chaotic, and rigid strategies don’t survive contact with reality. We stay fast and adaptive—ready to respond when a Supreme Court decision, a new technology, or a crisis creates an opening for progress. ▸ *When Chevron was overturned, we rapidly developed the Outcomes-Driven Legislation framework and convened three inter-branch working sessions* ▸ *When ChatGPT emerged in late 2022, we led the first Congressional conversations about responsible AI adoption within weeks* ▸ *When the 119th Congress faced shutdowns and federal workforce uncertainty, we launched Departure Dialogues to capture critical institutional knowledge* |
| ----: | :---- |

| 05 | We champion the institution, not a party. We’re nonpartisan by conviction, not just by tax status. Our work centers on making democratic institutions themselves stronger—and our effectiveness depends on being trusted across the aisle, across chambers, and across branches. ▸ *ModCom’s 202 recommendations were approved bipartisanly, often unanimously—and our work supported implementation across party lines* ▸ *The Gavel In podcast featured a bipartisan mix of current and former Members, Chiefs, and Congressional experts* ▸ *Our Future-Proofing Congress newsletter serves all staff, regardless of party, with resources on operational improvements* |
| ----: | :---- |

| 06 | We connect people who should be in the room together. Breakthroughs happen at the intersections: between branches of government, between countries, between the people who write laws and the people who live under them. We create those collisions deliberately. ▸ *Inter-branch exchange sessions brought legislative and executive staff together with researchers on SNAP, paid leave, and emergency response* ▸ *Congress 2076 convened scholars and practitioners to envision the institution’s next fifty years* ▸ *The International Legislative Modernization Working Group connects parliamentary staff from six countries for peer learning* ▸ *The Global Innovations in Democracy Parliamentary Exchange brings lawmakers from around the world to Washington* |
| ----: | :---- |

	

| 09 | We close the gap between what’s possible and what’s usable. The distance between a cutting-edge technology and what a legislative office can actually implement tomorrow is enormous. We bridge it—with training, frameworks, and tools designed for the reality of how legislatures actually work. ▸ *Representative Bodies in the AI Era: the first global survey of AI adoption in legislatures, designed as a practical guide* ▸ *The Outcomes-Driven Legislation framework gives staffers concrete tools for better bill-writing in a post-Chevron world* ▸ *Our earmarks resource guides became go-to references for staff navigating the restored process* |
| ----: | :---- |

| 10 | We play the long game. Our rapid responses to new developments are grounded in a long-term commitment to a clear vision: legislatures that are resilient, responsive, and equipped for a rapidly changing world. We move fast in the moment and slowly, deliberately, toward goals that will take decades to fully realize. ▸ *Five years of sustained casework advocacy—testimony, research, outreach—led to Case Compass being signed into law* ▸ *We’ve tracked and championed ModCom’s 202 recommendations from proposal through implementation* ▸ *Congress 2076 looks fifty years into the future, because real institutional change is generational work* |

# **Our Story**

POPVOX Foundation started with a simple, stubborn conviction: the people’s branch should have the tools to keep pace with a rapidly changing world.

Our co-founder, Marci Harris, has been working on this problem for over fifteen years. A lawyer and former House Ways and Means Committee staffer, she first founded POPVOX.com in 2010—a civic technology platform that connected constituents directly with their representatives during the legislative process. That experience taught her something that would shape everything that followed: Congress’s challenges weren’t just about connecting citizens to lawmakers. They were deeper, structural, institutional. The systems Congress relied on to do its work—from technology to staffing to data infrastructure—hadn’t kept pace with the demands of modern governance.

In 2021, Marci and her team launched POPVOX Foundation as a 501(c)(3) public charity, built from the start by proud former Congressional staffers from both sides of the aisle. The Foundation debuted with an orientation event for the incoming 117th Congress, testified before the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, and began the hands-on, nonpartisan capacity-building work that would become our signature.

What followed was rapid growth grounded in long-term vision. In our first year, we launched research initiatives on emerging technology in Congress, created Internapalooza to welcome Congressional interns, and partnered with the Bipartisan Policy Center on resources for the return of earmarks. By 2023, we had launched the Casework Navigator, kicked off national conversations about AI in Congress, created the Comparative Legislative Strengthening Project to connect modernizers globally, and seen the House Intern Resource Office funded as a direct descendant of our early pipeline work.

By 2024 and 2025, the scope of our impact had expanded dramatically. We published the first global survey of AI adoption in legislatures, launched the Digital Parliaments Project to support legislatures in the Caribbean and Africa, developed frameworks for post-Chevron legislating, and saw multiple POPVOX Foundation priorities signed into law as part of a bipartisan funding package—including the unified casework data schema we had championed since 2022\.

Today, we are a small, fast, women-led team of former Hill staffers, researchers, and technologists who believe that democratic institutions can be extraordinary—and that the path to getting there runs through the people who serve in them every day.

# **Notes & Next Steps**

This draft is intended as raw material for the website, not final copy. A few things to consider as you review:

▸ Voice and tone: The “How We Work” statements aim to be direct and confident without being self-congratulatory. They lean into what makes POPVOX Foundation distinctive (building, speed, practitioner focus) rather than describing activities generically. Adjust to taste.

▸ Examples: I’ve included 3–4 per statement. For the web, you may want to pick the strongest 1–2 per statement and link out to dedicated project pages for depth.

▸ The history section is just under 500 words and threads the POPVOX.com → POPVOX Foundation arc. You may want to add a personal note from Marci or reference specific Congressional committees/leaders by name.

▸ The condensed timeline pulls the highest-impact items from the full timeline. Some entries could link to blog posts, reports, or project pages on the site.

▸ Some of the dates in the timeline are approximate—drawn from what’s publicly available on the site. You’ll want to verify exact months from internal records.

▸ Not captured here but worth discussing: how to integrate this with the team page, individual project pages, and any visual/design direction for the site.
