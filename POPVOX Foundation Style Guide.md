# Style Guide

The purpose of this style guide is to create consistency for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and usage in our writing. Such consistency improves our ability to effectively communicate and enhances our professionalism. It shows we pay attention to details. (You may notice some guidance is offered in more than one section — that’s intentional to make it more discoverable.)

This Style Guide takes guidance from the Associated Press Stylebook for language guidelines and the [Government Printing Office Style Manual](https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/gpo-style-manual?path=/gpo/U.S.%20Government%20Publishing%20Office%20Style%20Manual/2016) for government-specific language. That said, the guide below is ours uniquely, as we sometimes diverge from AP and GPO.  

# Abbreviations and acronyms

For formal writing like testimony, spell out the name of the agency for the first mention and put the acronym or abbreviation afterward in parenthesis only when it is non-obvious to a Congress-savvy audience, referencing that on subsequent mentions. For op-eds, always spell out the name of the agency on first reference. For the First Branch Forecast newsletter, we diverge from AP Style, but try to avoid alphabet soup. Be mindful when you should spell out an agency’s acronym, depending on the audience. 

We generally use these:

* Amdt — Amendment  
* AFAIK — As far as I know  
* Approps — Appropriations  
* Cmte — Committee  
* CHA (on second mention as the Committee on House Administration is not as well known)  
* Ds and Rs (**no apostrophe**)  
* DC — District of Columbia (no periods)  
* DOJ — Department of Justice  
* EO — Executive Order  
* GAO — Government Accountability Office  
* GPO — Government Publishing Office  
* ICYMI — In case you missed it  
* NDAA — National Defense Authorization Act  
* OLC — Office of Legal Counsel  
* SubC or SubCmte — Subcommittee  
* US — United States (no periods)  
* WaPo — Washington Post

  **Standard Latin abbreviations** 

  When Latin abbreviations are used, follow this list:

* e.g. — exempli gratia, for example\*  
* et al. — et alibi, and elsewhere; et alii, or aliae, and others  
* etc. — et cetera, and others, and so forth  
* i.e. — id est, that is\*  
* N.B. — nota bene, make note; used to indicate that special attention should be paid to something  
  \*Be careful not to confuse the two.  
    
  **Information technology acronyms**   
  Spell out the name for the following upon first reference, and put the acronym or abbreviation afterward in parenthesis. Exceptions: URL and CSV. When referencing a CSV, explain what it is (e.g., say "publish the file in CSV, which is a spreadsheet format").  
* AWS — Amazon Web Services  
* CSV — comma separated variable  
* DaaS — Database as a Service  
* DDoS — Distributed Denial of Service  
* DNS — domain name system  
* IoT — Internet of Things  
* IP — internet protocol  
* ​​ISP — internet service provider  
* OCR — optical character recognition  
* URL — uniform resource locator

# Actions around legislation

* The Committee (favorably) reported  
* The House/Senate passed  
* Rep. x or Sen. x introduced  
* Congress enacted (if the legislation has been signed into law).

# Amendments

* When writing about Amendments, capitalize the word Amendment and use ordinal numbers like 21st Amendment or 14th Amendment.


# Amicus brief

Lowercase

# Appropriations

* Best practices for writing up appropriations one-pagers:  
* Include language from previous years’ report language and bill text related to your ask  
* Reference language included in the budget justification or testimony when applicable  
* When asking for money, reference the header names from the Appropriations Bill from the previous year to figure out which expense account your ask is coming from  
* Be sure to include the “why” \- show how your ask is relevant and important  
* When talking about money, provide an example of a change in real dollars and as a percentage. For example: the GAO received a $100 million increase in funding (+8%), to $743 million.

# Attorneys General

Attorneys General for plural form. Also Inspectors General.

# Bipartisan

Use only to indicate when referencing an item or activity Members from both the Democratic and Republican parties support (such as a bill, Dear Colleague letter, or a press conference).

# Capitalization

In general, only capitalize proper nouns. Leave general terms in lower case. Do not capitalize Federal, Government, or Leadership. 

* Exceptions: Administration, Amendment, Speaker, Internet, Member, Senator, Representative, Executive branch, Legislative branch *Note: the word “branch” is not capitalized.*  
* Do not capitalize **email** or **wi-fi** or **floor** (as in House floor)  
* See entry for Members of Congress for more details

Don’t capitalize **personal titles** unless they precede a name.

* For example: The director led the meeting. Director of Government Innovation Aubrey Wilson testified on the topic many times.

Do capitalize titles like Inspector General, Comptroller General, **etc**.

Do ***not*** capitalize seasons (e.g., fall 2023 not Fall 2023\)

# CaseCompass

Write as one word.

# “Citizen”/ “Constituent”

“Citizen” in the US context can imply immigration status. In most cases it is better to use other words unless referring specifically to a US citizen. These include: constituent, individual, person, participant, etc. 

Also, avoid the term “voter” unless used specifically in a context in which voting status is relevant. 

Remember: You do not have to be a citizen or a voter to be a constituent. MANY constituents are non-citizens and /or non-voters.

# Cofounder

Write as one word without a hyphen. 

# Cohost (and other words that use co to create a word that indicates occupation or status)

Write as one word without a hyphen. 

# Colors

Green		A7CAB1

Light Teal	87B7B5

Dark Teal	4D768C

Orange	FF7F50

# Colons

Capitalize the first word after a colon, only if what follows is a complete sentence. For example:

* We use several forms of external communication: email, social media, and formal letters.  
* We communicate with external audiences in a variety of ways: Email is how we reach many people through our newsletter, but we also rely on social media, earned media, and formal letters to Congress.

# Congress; Congressional 

Capitalize the two terms.

# Constitution; constitutional

Capitalize the Constitution when referencing the US Constitution; use lowercase for constitutional.

# Cosponsor, cosponsored

Write as one word without a hyphen. 

# Dates

In general, write out dates: July 9, 2015 rather than 8/15/2020. Abbreviate only Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec. Do not use st, nd, rd, or th when referencing specific days. For abbreviating days of the week, follow this standard: Mon., Tue., Wed., Thu., Fri., Sat., and Sun.

Use a simple dash for date ranges (e.g., July 1-4, 2024\)

# DC not D.C. 

# Democratic, not Democrat, e.g., the Democratic party.

# Describing policy procedures

Use the right language to describe the procedure: committees report legislation; a measure is referred to a committee; a committee can’t pass legislation

# Electoral College

Capitalized.

# Em dashes

Put a space before and after em dashes — like this. \[For Mac: press “option+shift+hyphen key”; For Window: Alt \+ 0151\]

# Executive order

Lowercase.

# Fiscal Year

Include the full four digits of the year on first reference and do not include a space between FY and its corresponding year. On second reference, include just the last two digits of the year. For example, FY2023 on first reference and FY23 for subsequent references.

# Fonts

Avenir (primarily LT Std, Next Condensed, Next LT, Heavy)  
Proxima Nova  
Lora

# Generative AI, GenAI

Spell out using two words. When abbreviating, write as GenAI as one word, capitalizing the letters G and then AI. 

# Geographic regions

Capitalize the traditional geographic regions in the United States: the Midwest, the North, the South, the West, and the combined regions (i.e., the Northeast, the Southeast, and the Southwest).

# Hyperlinks

Link the concept, not the source. For URLs, remove the "?" and everything that follows when pasting the URL. (This removes the trackers.)

Please err on the side of including links to provide our readers with more context, and consider that many (particularly staffers) may be newbies. Provide breadcrumbs even if it feels like overkill. It’s also good practice to amplify others’ work.

# Inspectors General for plural form

# Internet not internet

(with thanks to Vint Cerf)

# Legislation and related documents

Spell out the name of the bill upon first reference and put the bill number in parentheses after. Link to the legislation on Congress.gov on first mention. Refer to the bill by its acronym on subsequent mentions (e.g., PLUM Act on second mention).  When there are different versions in the chambers, describe it as the House’s version of the PLUM Act or the Senate’s version of the PLUM Act, etc.

* e.g., When will Congress pass [The Periodically Listing Updates to Management Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2043) (H.R. 2043)?  
* H.R. 416 (House bill)  
* S. 116 (Senate bill)  
* H. Res. 5 (House resolution)  
* H. Con. Res. 10 (House concurrent resolution)  
* H.J. Res. 21 (House joint resolution) S. Res. 50 (Senate resolution)  
* S. Con. Res. 17 (Senate concurrent resolution)  
* S.J. Res. 45 (Senate joint resolution)

POPVOX Foundation policy is to not endorse bills.

# Members of Congress 

Always refer to Members of Congress with a capitalized m in Member. Try to reduce the number of times you say member by substituting lawmaker or legislator. 

* Standard for POPVOX Foundation is Rep./Sen., and include state and party abbreviation, separated by a comma, within brackets. E.g., Rep. Marci Harris \[I, TN\] or Reps. Raskin \[D, MD\] and Khanna \[D, CA\].   
  * Note that there is a period after the abbreviation for singular and plural instances of the title.  
  * (When relevant, include the district as in Rep. Marci Harris \[I, TN-2\].)  
* For retired Members of Congress, err on the side of adding contextual affiliation information, so include \[Party, State\] – but not district.   
  * When a retired Member has changed parties, please include a parenthetical about the switch. NB: The goal is to reference what district they represented while in office, even if they moved after retiring.  
* For leadership positions: it’s preferable to include the \[Party, State\] affiliation, but it’s ok to omit if makes the copy too clunky for the reader to easily absorb. (In other words, please use your judgment and/or check in if you have questions.)   
* POPVOX Foundation policy is to not single out specific Members for opposing legislation.

## Committee Chairs and Ranking Members

The House and Senate can use various language to refer to the committee chair. Some say chair, some say chairman, or chairwoman; for the ranking member, some committees use vice chair. It’s generally okay to say Chair and Ranking Member or RM.

# Names

Use full names on first reference. On second reference, use first names when writing about our teams or our work, and otherwise use last names on second reference, without a preceding title like Mr. or Ms.

* Note: If the context means that there’s a chance of confusion on second reference when using only first or last names, use full names.

# Nonpartisan

One word without hyphenation.

# Nonprofit

One word without hyphenation.

# Numbers

In general, spell out numbers as POPVOX Foundation is more formal in its approach. Specifically, write out one through twenty and multiples of ten in English, use Arabic numerals for numbers above twenty (that aren’t multiples of ten) like this:

* At the hearing, twelve Members of Congress presided, forty staffers sat in the audience, and 23 journalists attended.

Exceptions: 

* When reporting on percentages, use the number followed by a percent sign like 12%.  
* When writing about Amendments: use the number and include ordinal numbers like 21st Amendment or 14th Amendment. 

Use a comma to delineate thousands-separator (e.g., 10,000 or 1,000). Use figures with million, billion, or trillion (in lowercase) like this: 

* I need $8 billion.  
* The government ran a deficit of more than $1 trillion.  
* They received a grant totalling $280,000. 

Do not go beyond two decimal places. For example,

* 7.51 million people for 7,549,899 people  
* $256 billion for $2,234,239,000

Decimals are preferred where practical. For example,

* 1.5 million

\-not-

* 1 1/2 million

Do not mix millions and billions in the same figure. For example,

* 2.5 billion

\-not-

* 2 billion 500 million

Do not drop the word million or billion into the first figure of a range. For example,

* He is worth $4 million to $5 million.

\-not-

* He is worth $4 to $5 million.

(Unless that is, of course, you actually mean $4.)

Note that a hyphen is not used to join the figures and the word “million” or “billion,” even in this type of phrase: “The president submitted a $300 billion budget.”

In headlines, abbreviate only millions, billions, or trillions. For example:  

* $5M lawsuit, $17.4B deficit, $3T in savings

Use numerals for units of measurement, numbers in tables, decimals, ages and other specific situations. 

For ages, hyphenate, as in

* Jane Doe is a 62-year-old senator

# Percent 

Use the % symbol.

# Phone numbers

Use this format: (202) 423-5578. For U.S. numbers, use hyphens, no periods.  
For international: \+41.91.555.1212 use \+country code, number divided by periods

# Policymaker and Policymaking (one word)

# POPVOX Foundation

Capitalize all the letters in POPVOX and capitalize the F in Foundation. Be sure to include the word Foundation to differentiate the nonprofit from POPVOX the for-profit platform. Do not include the article “the” before the name of the organization.

# Punctuation

Simple punctuation is always preferred. Use periods and commas regularly and semicolons, colons, dashes, and exclamation points sparingly for clarification or ease of reading. We use the Oxford comma: Living in Hawaii, I miss eating fresh raspberries, peaches, and apples. Use commas and periods inside quotation marks or parentheses with full sentences and outside them with fragments.

* Example: Replace the “blame game” with “lessons learned.”

Use periods at the end of items in a bulleted list only if they are complete sentences. Don’t add commas to the ends of list items. Be consistent between sentences or fragments in a list.

For example, create a list:

* This thing  
* That thing  
* The other thing

Another example:

* This is a sentence. So is this.  
* Yet another sentence. A sentence is a sentence.  
* Still another sentence.

Follow GPO Style, which states: “The possessive case of a singular or plural noun not ending in s is formed by adding an apostrophe and s. The possessive case of a sin- gular or plural noun ending in s or with an s sound is formed by adding an apostrophe only.”

For example:

* boss’, bosses’  
* child’s, children’s   
* citizen’s, citizens’   
* Congress’, Congresses’ criterion’s, criteria’s 

FYI our Style is: Harris’ and Walz’s

# Quotation Marks 

Punctuation should go inside quotation marks. These quotations are correctly punctuated:

* “Would you like to meet for lunch?” he asked.  
* “Sure, that would be great,” she said. “Let’s go to the new salad place.”  
* He paused before saying “I heard their greens are very fresh.”  
* Use single quotes for quote-in-quote: He paused before saying, “I think she said ‘the greens are very fresh.’”

Generally, quotation marks can be used around a word or phrase to set it apart and to show irony, sarcasm, or skepticism (scare quotes). Only use quotation marks in this manner to signify skepticism.  

When transcribing an interview, use double quotation marks when the speaker is quoting real or hypothetical dialogue. For example: My Deputy Chief of Staff said, “Here is your opening remarks and here are your questions,” and I said, “How do you know these are my questions?” 

# “Revolving door”

Use quotes on first usage of the phrase.

# Rules

Capitalize the r in House Rules. For other rules, such as committee rules, use a lowercase r.

# Seasons

Do not capitalize seasons (Ex: fall 2023 not Fall 2023\)

# Spacing

Use one space after a period. \[Do a Ctrl-F to make sure you don’t have 2 spaces between sentences.\]

# Time

Use figures except for noon and midnight. Another instance where diverge from AP Style. Use a colon to separate hours from minutes and capitalize AM/PM. Use en-dash between time range: 11 AM, 1 PM, 3:30 PM, 8≠10 AM, 9 AM to 5 PM, 10:30 AM–12 PM. Noon is 12 PM. Avoid redundancies such as 10 AM this morning. Please include ET or EDT/EST when communicating beyond the Beltway.

# Titles

Capitalize titles only when they appear directly before a person’s name. For example: Senior Communications Advisor Gabriela Schneider said the Senate will adjourn early. According to Gabriela Schneider, senior communications advisor at POPVOX Foundation, the Senate will adjourn early. A formal title generally is one that describes a scope of authority, professional activity or academic activity. Examples: Dr. Benjamin Spock, retired Gen. Wesley Clark. Other titles serve primarily as occupational descriptions: physicist Nikola Tesla, actress Helen Mirren.

# US not U.S.

# website (one word; not capitalized)
