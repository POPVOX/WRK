# REBOOT CONGRESS 2026

## Rebuilding Legislative Capacity for the AI Era

**A POPVOX Foundation Major Initiative**

---

## Executive Summary

REBOOT CONGRESS is a year-long research and engagement initiative culminating in comprehensive recommendations for the 120th Congress (January 2027). Through monthly chapter releases, quarterly staff events, and prototype tool development, we will build the intellectual foundation and practical toolkit for modernizing congressional operations in the age of artificial intelligence.

This initiative connects and extends work across POPVOX Inc and POPVOX Foundation, synthesizing years of research on legislative data, congressional capacity, and democratic technology into actionable recommendations.

---

## The Challenge

Congress faces an unprecedented capacity crisis at the precise moment it must make consequential decisions about artificial intelligence, algorithmic systems, and the future of democratic governance. The legislative branch lacks:

- **Modern data infrastructure** to access and analyze information at the speed and scale of the challenges it addresses
- **Technical capacity** to understand, oversee, and regulate emerging technologies
- **Institutional memory** to learn from past decisions and build on previous work
- **Coordination mechanisms** that enable effective multi-office and cross-branch collaboration
- **Security frameworks** adequate to protect sensitive constituent and deliberative data

Meanwhile, AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, constituent expectations are rising, and executive branch agencies are adopting AI systems that Congress cannot effectively oversee.

---

## The Opportunity

The same technologies creating oversight challenges also offer solutions. AI-enabled systems can:

- Transform how Congress captures, organizes, and retrieves institutional knowledge
- Augment staff capacity without replacing human judgment
- Enable new forms of coordination across offices, committees, and chambers
- Improve constituent services while protecting privacy
- Create accountability mechanisms for both congressional and executive AI use

The 120th Congress has an opportunity to implement meaningful reforms if recommendations are ready, practical, and backed by demonstrated proof of concept.

## Project Goals

### Primary Deliverable
A comprehensive report with actionable recommendations for the 120th Congress covering:
- House and Senate rules changes

- New tools and infrastructure
- Governance and oversight frameworks

### Supporting Deliverables

## Success Metrics

### By December 2026
- [ ] Complete report with recommendations adopted by at least one modernization champion
- [ ] 3+ committee staff briefings on recommendations
- [ ] 50+ Hill staff engaged through events
- [ ] 2+ prototype tools with congressional office pilots
- [ ] 5+ partner organization endorsements
- [ ] Trade press coverage establishing POPVOX as leader on congressional AI

### By 120th Congress (January 2027)
- [ ] Recommendations included in at least one rules package proposal
- [ ] Appropriations language reflecting capacity recommendations
- [ ] Ongoing relationships with key modernization staff

## Working Principles

1. **Bipartisan by Design**: All recommendations must be implementable regardless of which party controls each chamber
2. **Practical Over Theoretical**: Every recommendation connects to implementation pathway
3. **Demonstrate, Don't Just Describe**: Prototype tools prove concepts before recommending adoption
4. **Human Authority**: AI augments staff capacity; humans retain decision authority
5. **Privacy by Default**: All frameworks prioritize constituent and deliberative privacy
6. **Build on What Exists**: Leverage existing congressional infrastructure where possible
